#### I made a mini game where a green dot or the agent has to cross a road with cars ðŸš— without crashing, I trained an AI to play it all by itself using a brain called PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

## What it does:
The game runs in the terminal using emojis

Cars come from both sides and try to hit you

The AI learns how to avoid them and reach the top safely

It keeps playing until it scores 5 points or crashes
